Horizontal and vertical rows are removed when they are full. In the further course of the game
more tokens are added. In the lower area of the playing field takes place when clearing away
gravity takes place in horizontal rows. The pieces from the upper playing field slide downwards.

A token can be parked in the blue field.

The game ends when you can't put any more pieces into the field. This is the case,
if at least one gray tile is displayed in the lower area and also a gray one
Game piece is parked. It is therefore always advisable to close parked game pieces as quickly as possible
play.

The game is designed for Android 7 devices in portrait mode.
The game already works and is constantly being developed.

The game is open source and should be permanently free and ad-free. No in-app purchases.
It is my first Android app and is used to learn Android programming
including Android Studio and Kotlin. The game is addicting.


Sorry guys, game language is German.
